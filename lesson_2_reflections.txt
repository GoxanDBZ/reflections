WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY? WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?

A new hidden folder named ".git" has been created. It will store all the meta-data of project's
different states.

HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY AND THE REPOSITORY? WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT OFFERS?

Files that are ready to be commited are being put in the "staging area". If by any chance, user changes his/hers mind
it can remove them from there rather than immediately commit the changes.
