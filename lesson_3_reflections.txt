WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO CREATE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

When I'm sattisfied enough with my project and I want to share it online.

WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

Because I would like to pull only those changes that I think are required for my project.
